# Brain-Tumor-CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network with the VGG Architecture.
This particular model was implemented in a short timespan so beware it MAY be a bit rough around the edges but I encourage you to look around and make changes as you see fit to potentially improve its performance.
The model was tested/trained against the following metrics:
1. accuracy
2. loss
3. recall
4. f1 score
The Model was created on Jupyter Labs, But alternatively it can even run on VSCode with a similar interface if need be.
I coded it in an older version of Python (3.9.20) as the latest one doesn't run tensorflow-gpu which i needed to alleviate a potential OOM error (I didn't want to fry my GPU on the first go :]).
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle, I've included its zip file for ease of access.
Be sure to reach out if you want help with any technical aspects of the procedure. 
Feel free to use the model itself or the code for your personal projects, all I ask is that you credit me if you do decide to publish it in any capacity.
Good Luck!
