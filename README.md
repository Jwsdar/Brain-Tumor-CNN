# Brain-Tumor-CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network with the VGG Architecture. Implemented this particular model in short timespan so beware it MAY be a bit rough around the edges but I encourage you to look around and make changes as you see fit to potentially improve its performance.
I coded it in an older version of Python (3.9.20) as the latest one doesn't run tensorflow-gpu which i needed to alleviate an OOM error.
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle, I've included its zip file.
Feel free to use the model itself or the code for your personal projects, all I ask is you credit me if you do decide to publish it in any capacity.
