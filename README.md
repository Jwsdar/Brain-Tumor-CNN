# Brain-Tumor-CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network with the VGG Architecture, Implemented it over the weekend so beware it MAY be a bit rough around the edges. P.S: I coded it in an older version of Python (3.9.20). Feel free to use the model itself or the code for your personal projects, all I ask is you credit me if you do decide to publish it in any capacity.
